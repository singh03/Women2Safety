Safety app for women
There are basically many women safety apps in the market,but what this app aim's is to find the location of the person 
without using google map services and gprs. Yes, this is possible. Many a times it is possible that the person does not have  
a good network connection. In that case this app will help to get an almost accurate location of that person. This app is still 
under working conditions and the main idea of locating the person without map and gprs is to use the internal build in app of android. They seem quite simple but provide much information.They are barometer,accelerometer,magnetic compass etc.
