safety app for women
There are basically many women safety apps in the market,but what this app aims is to find the location of the person 
without using google maps services and gprs. Yes, this is possible. Many a times it may be possible that the person does not have  
a good network connection. In that case this app will help to get an almost accurate location of that person. This app is still 
under working conditions and the main idea of locating the person without maps and gprs will be disclosed soon.
